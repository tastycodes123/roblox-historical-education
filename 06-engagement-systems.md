## System 3: Work Gang Reputation ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Four Gangs:**
- Red Gang: "Khufu's Mighty Ones" - Strength challenges, heavy stone transport
- Blue Gang: "The Great Gang" - Precision cutting and placement
- Gold Gang: "Khufu's Swift Workers" - Speed and ramp construction
- Green Gang: "The Enduring Gang" - Finishing work and lasting quality

**System:** Join gang, contribute points through missions, leaderboard, visual pyramid progress

**Historical Note:** Real pyramid workers organized into proud gangs with names like "The Strong Gang" and "Khufu's Followers." Our gangs use historically-grounded naming patterns while keeping gameplay clear with color-coded UI elements.

**Gang Identity:**
- UI: Color-coded reputation bars (Red/Blue/Gold/Green)
- In-world: NPCs refer to gangs by full name
- Territory: Each gang works specific pyramid sections
- Boasting: Gang members brag about their specialty

**Player Experience:**
- Join one gang early in game (choice matters for missions)
- Earn reputation through quality work and completed tasks
- Unlock gang-specific dialogue and respect from NPCs
- See pyramid progress attributed to your gang's efforts

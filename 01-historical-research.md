## Environment Details

### Architecture

**Construction Site:**
- Massive limestone blocks (2.5 tons average) on wooden sledges
- Spiral ramps around pyramid (currently 2/3 complete, ~100 meters tall, will reach 146m)
- Cedar scaffolding lashed with palm fiber rope at work platforms
- Copper tools: chisels, saws, mallets scattered at work stations
- Survey stations with plumb bobs and cubit measuring rods
- Stone-cutting workshops with copper saws using sand as abrasive
- Quarry pits nearby with partially cut blocks still attached to bedrock
- Work gang flags marking sections (Red, Blue, Gold, Green gangs)

**Worker Village:**
- Mudbrick houses in orderly rows (planned community, not organic)
- Single-story structures with flat roofs, some beams protruding
- Communal bakeries with distinctive dome-shaped ovens
- Beer breweries (bread and beer are primary payment)
- Small shrine to Ptah (patron god of craftsmen)
- Barracks for seasonal workers (long buildings, communal sleeping)
- Medical facility (evidence of surgical treatment for injuries)
- Granaries raised on wooden stilts (rodent protection)
- Open courtyards between buildings for shade and outdoor work

**Pyramid (In Progress):**
- Base complete with gleaming white Tura limestone casing stones (polished smooth)
- Upper sections show rough-cut core blocks (casing added top-down later)
- Red painted survey marks and block numbering system visible
- Constant activity: positioning, measuring, adjusting
- Dust haze from cutting and grinding operations

### Sensory Details

**Sounds:**
- Rhythmic work chanting: "Heave! Heave! Heave!" in Egyptian (synchronized rope pulling)
- Copper chisels on limestone: sharp rhythmic tapping
- Stone grinding stone: deep scraping sound
- Wooden mallets on chisels: hollow thunking
- Rope creaking under strain
- Overseers calling orders, shouting worker names
- Children playing between buildings
- Water sloshing from skin bags onto sand paths
- Donkeys braying (supply transport)
- Bread ovens crackling with fire
- Wind whistling through scaffold poles
- Evening: workers singing, conversation, laughter

**Smells:**
- Limestone dust: chalky, dry, catches in throat
- Heavy sweat (constant in desert heat)
- Wet sand: earthy, slightly musty
- Bread baking: yeasty, sweet (strongest morning and evening)
- Beer brewing: sour fermented grain
- Cooking fish (Nile perch): smoky, savory
- Onions and leeks cooking (worker rations)
- Donkey dung near animal pens
- Oil lamps: slightly acrid smoke
- Copper tools: metallic tang when heated from use
- Desert air: dry, dusty, clean away from work

**Lighting:**
- Harsh desert sun: bright, almost white light, sharp shadows
- Midday: shadows almost disappear (sun overhead)
- Dust creates golden haze in late afternoon
- Building interiors: dark, cool, eyes need adjustment time
- Small windows near roofline create shafts of light
- Evening: oil lamps create warm, flickering orange glow
- Torches: smoky, brighter, used for urgent night work
- Stars: incredibly bright and clear (no light pollution)

**Weather/Time Effects:**
- Dawn (5am): Cool, workers gathering, bread distributed
- Mid-morning (8-10am): Heat building, full work pace
- Midday (12-2pm): Brutal heat, slower work, shade breaks
- Afternoon (2-5pm): Still hot, steady work continues
- Evening (after 6pm): Cooler, work winds down, social time

**Skilled Workers (Stone Cutters, Carpenters):**
- Men: Linen kilts (coarser weave), shorter
- Often shirtless
- Usually barefoot, occasionally simple sandals
- Simple copper or bronze jewelry, amulets
- Short hair or shaved heads (practical in heat/dust)

**Unskilled Laborers:**
- Men: Simple loincloth, sometimes just waistcloth

### Social Hierarchy

**Power Structure (Top to Bottom):**
1. Pharaoh Khufu (god-king, never seen by common workers)
2. Vizier (chief administrator, rare inspection visits)
3. Architect Hemiunu (present occasionally, oversees design)
4. Chief Overseer (daily presence, manages entire site)
5. Section Overseers (direct supervision of work gangs)
6. Gang Leaders (experienced workers, lead teams of 10-20)
7. Skilled Workers (stone cutters, carpenters, metal workers)
8. Unskilled Laborers (rope pullers, water carriers)
9. Servants (support staff, cooks, cleaners)

**How Power is Shown:**
- Clothing quality and jewelry amount
- Ability to give orders vs receive them
- Access to shade (upper class has parasol bearers)
- Food quality (upper class gets meat, wine)
- Seating (chairs vs ground)
- Right to carry staff or rod (authority symbol)
- Literacy (scribes have high status despite no manual labor)

**Social Rules:**
- Address superiors by title, never name
- Lower workers bow slightly when addressed by overseer
- Don't speak unless spoken to by higher status
- Work gangs have names (pride/competition): "Khufu's Strong Gang"
- Bringing water to someone shows respect
- Sharing food creates bonds
- Protecting gang members' honor (fights over insults)

### Daily Routines

**Morning (Dawn - 8am):**
- Workers wake before sunrise in barracks
- Morning bread ration (1 loaf per person)
- Beer ration (thick, nutritious, safer than water)
- Work gangs assemble in open area
- Overseer calls roll, assigns tasks
- Tools distributed from supply depot
- Work begins as sun rises

**Midday (Noon - 2pm):**
- Work slows in peak heat
- Shade breaks under cloth shelters
- Water carriers constantly circulating
- Quick meal: bread, onions, beer
- Some workers rest, others do lighter tasks

**Evening (Sunset - Night):**
- Work ends when overseer signals
- Tools returned and counted
- Second major meal: bread, fish or vegetables, beer
- Workers wash at communal basin
- Social time: senet games, storytelling, music
- Families gather, children play
- Repairs to tools, rope, equipment
